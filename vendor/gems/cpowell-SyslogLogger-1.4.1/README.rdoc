= SyslogLogger

http://github.com/cpowell/sysloglogger/tree

== DESCRIPTION:

SyslogLogger is a Logger replacement that logs to syslog. It is almost drop-in
with a few caveats. You can add SyslogLogger to your Rails production
environment to aggregate logs between multiple machines.

NOTE! You can only set the SyslogLogger program name when you initialize
SyslogLogger for the first time. This is a limitation of the way SyslogLogger
uses syslog (and in some ways, a limitation of the way syslog(3) works).
Attempts to change SyslogLogger's program name after the first initialization
will be ignored.

This particular SyslogLogger is a fork of the original, which can be found here:

http://seattlerb.rubyforge.org/SyslogLogger

== SYNOPSIS:

=== config/environment.rb

  config.gem "cpowell-SyslogLogger", :source=>'http://gems.github.com', :lib=>'syslog_logger'

=== config/environments/production.rb

(Only this environment, since you probably only want to enable it for Production, and not Test or Development.)

  require 'syslog_logger'
  RAILS_DEFAULT_LOGGER = SyslogLogger.new 

By default, SyslogLogger uses the program name 'rails', but this can be
changed via the first argument to SyslogLogger.new:

  RAILS_DEFAULT_LOGGER = SyslogLogger.new(program_name = 'mygreatapp')
  
=== BSD syslog setup

==== /etc/syslog.conf

Add the following lines:

  !rails
  *.*                                             /var/log/production.log

Then touch /var/log/production.log and signal syslogd with a HUP
(killall -HUP syslogd, on FreeBSD).

==== /etc/newsyslog.conf

Add the following line:

  /var/log/production.log                 640  7     *    @T00  Z

This creates a log file that is rotated every day at midnight, gzip'd, then
kept for 7 days.  Consult newsyslog.conf(5) for more details.

=== syslog-ng setup

==== syslog-ng.conf

A basic setup:

  destination rails_log { file("/var/log/production.log"); };
  filter f_rails { program("rails.*"); };
  log { source(src); filter(f_rails); destination(rails_log); };

A more advanced setup with formatting, etc:

  destination rails { file("/var/log/rails_apps" owner("rails") group("rails") perm(0664) template("$DATE $HOST $PROGRAM [$LEVEL] $MSGONLY\n") template_escape(no) ); };
  filter f_rails    { (program("railsappone") or program("railsapptwo")) and not match("SQL ") and not match("SELECT") and not match("INSERT INTO") and not match("UPDATE"); };
  log { source(src); filter(f_rails); destination(rails); };

=== Starting

Now restart your Rails app. Your production logs should now be showing up in
/var/log/production.log. If you have mulitple machines, you can log them all
to a central machine with remote syslog logging for analysis. Consult your
syslogd(8) manpage for further details.

== INSTALL:

  $ gem sources -a http://gems.github.com (you only have to do this once)
  $ sudo gem install cpowell-SyslogLogger
