= LockBox

LockBox is a centralized API authentication service written by the DNC Innovation Lab. It lets your API 
users share a single identity across multiple services.  
It is licensed under the New BSD License (see the LICENSE file for details).

It is a Ruby on Rails application on the server side, and Rack middleware on the client side
(which means it integrates nicely with any modern Ruby web framework).

Lockbox handles things like rate limiting, API key signup and management, and supports HMAC
authentication as well as plain-text key exchange.
